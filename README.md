A sample web app for online marketplace

##A brief Overview 
This web app contains the jist of things which I have learnt while exploring the beautiful world of Spring MVC.
This was done a long time back but is added so as to preserve it. I still find few things implemented in this app quite intimidating and thus can refer to this app in future.

##Technology Stack
  1. Spring MVC : For complete app backbone and controllers
  2. Spring Security : For login functionality
  3. Angular JS : For calling some REST API's. Not used extensively.
  4. JSPs : Major view components
  6. HSQLDB(Compliant with any relational DB) : Persistent store
