##A brief Overview 
This web app contains the jist of things which I have learnt while exploring the beautiful world of Spring MVC.
This was done a long time back but is added so as to preserve it. I still find somethings implemented in this app quite intimidating and thus can refer to this app in future.

##Technology Stack
  1. Spring MVC
  2. Spring Security
  3. Angular JS
